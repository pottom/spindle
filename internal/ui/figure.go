// The figures: small line drawings that walk about the screen.
//
// They are not drawn by this code. They come from pictures somebody else drew,
// converted to dots by cmd/spindle-figures and written into figures_gen.go —
// so what happens at playback time is a lookup and a blit, and adding another
// figure is a folder of drawings and a ten line manifest.
//
// What the drawing does not carry is a face. A still picture cannot blink, and
// the one thing this screen is for is answering the music, so the head is left
// hollow by the generator and the face is drawn into it — the same eyes, brows
// and mouth that were there before, following the same sound.
